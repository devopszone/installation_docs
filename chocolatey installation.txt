--Chocolatey is a package manager for Windows (like apt-get but for Windows). 
It was designed to be a decentralized framework for quickly installing applications and tools that you need.

***Install with cmd.exe**
#  @powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))" && SET "PATH=%PATH%;%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\chocolatey\bin"

***Install with PowerShell.exe***

With PowerShell, there is an additional step. 
You must ensure Get-ExecutionPolicy is not Restricted. We suggest using Bypass to bypass the policy to get things installed or AllSigned for quite a bit more security.

Run Get-ExecutionPolicy. If it returns Restricted, 
then run Set-ExecutionPolicy AllSigned or Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass

#iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))

Ex: choco install python3
    choco install firefox
    choco install vlc
